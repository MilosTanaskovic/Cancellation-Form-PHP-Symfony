Cancellation

How to cancel domain/service?

1) Regular domain cancellation
2) Immediate domain cancellation
3) Regular service cancellation
4) Immediate service cancellation

Cancellation is a process of permanently stoping subscription. It can involve both domain and service subscription at the same time and there are several possible scenarios given the options on cancellation form and the existence of domain and/or service subscription in the system.

1 (Checkbox) ->I wish to cancel the registered domain name.

2 (Checkbox) -> I wish to cancel the additional service related to the above domain name.

3 (Checkbox) -> Upon cancellation of additional service, I wish to disable and remove the service immediately.

*Regular domain cancellation 

The first scenario, cancellation of domain subscription is covered by checking the option "I wish to cancel the registered domain name" (1)

If a given domain is Premium domain and if it has connected service to it ( service with the same domain name) then this service will also be a subject of cancellation implicity even without checking the option "I wish to cancel the additional service related to the above domain name" on cancellation form (2).

*Immediate domain cancellation 

The second scenario, called immediate cancellation of domain subscription is variant of the previous one with the checking of additional option "Upon cancellation of additional service, I wish to disable and remove the service immediately" on cancellation form (1 & 3).

Likewise the previous, if the given domain is Premium domain and if it has connected service to it (service with the same domain name) then this service will also be a subject of immediate cancellation implicity even without checking the option "I wish to cancel the additional service related to the above domain name" on cancellation form (2)

*Regular service cancellation 

In the third scenario, the simplest scenario is a cancellation of a service subscription and it is covered by checking only the option "I wish to cancel the additional service related to the above domain name" on cancellation form (2). The service will be terminated on the due date.

*Immediate service cancellation 

Forth scenario, called immediate cancellation of a service subscription is variant of the firs scenario with checking of additional options "Upon cancellation of additional service, I wish to disable and remove the service immediately " on cancellation form (2 & 3). Termination of service is immediate and all services included (mail, DNS, and web) are stopped when the cancellation is processed.
